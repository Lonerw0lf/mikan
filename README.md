## Introduction

Get a full MyAnimeList information on any kind of anime and manga (WIP) using their respective MAL ID.  
Made for our new soon-to-be-released app Setsuna and for future projects.  
 
It is **free** and has no limits of now _(30/12/2017)_

Example: [https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note), in this case the MAL ID is 1535. Check Usage to see how to interact with the API.

## Usage

Host:	[https://initiate.host/](https://initiate.host/)    

**JSON Rest API.**    
Normal Usage: /anime/{ID}  i.e.: [https://initiate.host/anime/1](https://initiate.host/anime/1)
  
For logs:
/stratum/loggs/{ID}
In case you want to filter the level, use:
/stratum/loggs/{ID}?level={level}
as level can be: error, debug or info

Do not share the request ID with anyone, as in the logs it contains your IP Address, only use it for yourself or to open an issue.

## Issues

Mikan is currently in development, do expect some little bugs (no missing data), and if you face any issue, open an issue with the request ID from the Json.
